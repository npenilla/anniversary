		<h1 class=h1> Here we have our most recent year, and man it's been an experience. I feel like we grew even more and matured together in new ways. We both stopped being teenagers together and I feel like we really started becoming adults this year, doing and thinking about more adult things. We've had some ins and outs but everything we conqueured and every problem we solved we did together, and I love that I feel like we really added a lot of depth to our relationship this year. Every relationship is different, but I really love all the time we spent together, and I feel like we have so much more to explore and experience together.</h1>

		<p class=y3p2> It was so awesome getting to work together as lifeguards! I loved seeing you randomly throughout my day and being able to go to disney whenever we wanted and both being cast members and sharing those experiences. I'll always love that we got the cliche summer of working as lifeguards together, feels like something out of a teen movie. Although I will say it was hard to see you walking around in that bathing suit and not being able to do anything about it because we were at work.</p>

		<p class=y3p3> We need to cook another meal together. This was such a cool experience learning some new techniques and really putting our teamwork to the test. Not to mention we made some really good food and spent some really good quality time together.</p>

		<p class=y3p4> I will literally never get tired of meeting new puppies and spending time playing with them, it always feels like our little family. </p>

		<p class=y3p5> We got to have our best vacation yet this year too! Oh man that experience was absolutely unbelievable and every second was pure fun. I absolutely cannot wait to do another one this year and you know it's coming!</p>

		<p class=y3p6> Another cute holiday for us decorating cookies! I hope we can keep doing fun cute stuff like this forever, because it really makes our memories.</p>

		<p class= y3p7> Not to mention another great Halloween memory! I loved this weekend because even though I had so much to do, I could just take a little break and enjoy everything with you. Our costume was awesome and even better that we compiled it all ourselves, I got to show off my muscles and you got to show off your beauty. You looked way better than Meg did in that dress, and I want you to know it.</p>

		<p class=y3p8> And here we come to one of my favorite memories we have together, our Miami trip. I love our vacations of course as I've said, but this one was cool because I got to see a LOT of stuff I've never seen before, and you guided me to that and showed me some new experiences. In addition to all this, you got to show off your new gym work at the beach, and you killed it. It was nice to get out of Orlando for a little bit, and I'm so happy I ended up coming instead of chickening out. I can't wait to go back next week! I love you.</p>
