		<h1> Here's a page dedicated to letting you know how I feel about you, and reasons why I'm so proud of you and love being with you. Enjoy! </h1>

		<p class=h1> Taliah, I know sometimes I don't tell you nearly as often as you should, but I love you more than anything. You've  been there through the good and the bad, and you've completely changed the way I think and feel about myself for the better. You've given me advice, listened, talked and just all around been a great friend, girlfriend, and more than I could ask for. I can't imagine life without you, my partner in crime, and just the person I want to share everything with. I want to give you so much, and you're gonna see that today, but even more than this someday, and I hope you feel the same. </p>

		<p class=beauty> I love so many aspects of you. You're fun to be around, and we always have such a good time, but I can't forget to tell you just how beautiful you are. Your eyes are always just a dream to look at, and even when you say you look bummy I could stare at you all day. I love your cute little smile, and your joyful laugh, and how amazing you look in your dresses and even though it takes you forever to get ready I know it's always worth it. Don't ever feel like you have to chagne or that you aren't the hottest, prettiest girl in whichever room you're in, because it just isn't true. </p>
		
		<p class=h2>I'm so proud of the woman I'm seeing you become, and I'm so happy I can be a part of that journey. I love watching you achieve something new, and it makes me so happy that you're getting recognized for your hard work. It's so cool to me that halfway through your college career you've still kept a perfect 4.0 GPA. Believe me, I've seen the work you put in and it isn't easy.</p>

		<p class=h3>Even with the work you do for classes, you're still involved in multiple organizations and contribute to the student body, which is no small task. You worked hard to apply for the MFOS Mentor position and you worked hard to apply for UMA, and you've continued to work to be a part of these organizations, and I know it isn't always easy.</p>

		<p class=h4> Of course I'll always think you're beautiful, stunning and a work of art no matter what, but I'm also super proud of the crazy progress you've made in the gym this year. You go consistently, and of course things come up and we get busy but I you still haven't given up on the gym, and that's more than a lot of people can say about it. You've gotten skinnier, more muscular, and I'm sure you feel a lot better, because that's how I felt when I started going too. I'm so proud of your progress and if you keep it going I'll be happy to see more. </p>

		<p class=h5> I love you so much. I really do, and it's crazy to think how much we've improved. I really hope you enjoyed all this and I can't wait to do something even bigger next year. You're awesome and an amazing woman, and I know you'll make an amazing wife and mother someday, and hopefully that'll be an experience we share together. I love you.</p>
