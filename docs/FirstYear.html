		<h1 class=h1>This was our first year together. Man we had so much fun! Young love and all that. We were madly in love (not saying we still aren't, but it was the young dumb kinda love) and it was so great. We went through our super long honeymoon phase and got to learn so much about each other. I know we've grown a lot and even though we've changed, I'm sure the Taliah and Nigel from this period would be really proud and excited about the people we are now. It's crazy to me how much we've been through since then, but I wouldn't change it for anything.</h1>

		<p class=p2> I went to my very first homecoming, and I got to bring the prettiest girl in the entire school, so thanks for that. It was such a blast and we both looked great and felt great and I still think about that time a lot. I was so proud of you for getting on homecoming court too because I knew you deserved it. Dancing with you is a feeling that I love more than anything. </p>

		<p class =p3> This was my favorite picture of us for a long time. We both looked so old and mature I thought, and its so funny looking back now because we look so young. I always love our Disney Springs dates and that we can still find stuff to do even today. </p>

		<p class=p4> Never forget this epic meme from way back when. There's another reference to this one up in our second year too! </p>

		<p class=p5> Oh man I loved watching you cheer! It was so cool man I still can't believe I dated the cheer captain! That's such a cliche, but one I'm still proud of. You always looked great and kicked ass in your cheer uniform, and I absolutely had a blast being your number one fan. Thanks for all the baked treats too, you introduced me to the glory that is slutty brownies.</p>

		<p class=p6> Can't forget our first Disney trip! Where we accidentally matched for the whole day. Waking up early and just having full days at Disney was so fun, it was a great time. Holding hands under the fireworks was such an intimate and romantic moment and felt like something right out of a fairy tale. </p>

		<p class=p7> Dude the freaking Osborne lights, holy crap that was awesome. I'm so glad you took me there and showed me that because I'd never seen something so cool before. All the little easter eggs and everything like that was insane, I would've hated to miss something like that. </p>

		<p class=p8> Last but not least we can't forget the mind-boggling experience of PROM! It took me quite a while to get the perfect promposal idea but I thought it fit you really well. Oh man if I thought you looked stellar at homecoming you blew me and everyone else away with your prom look. We looked like models but your look was crazy man. Your dress and makeup an hair and everything in between was just a treasure to look at. I loved it. We danced some of our best dance moves ever and I can't wait until we're 21 and dancing at BoardWalk. You looked so great baby but I'm sure you'll top it on our wedding day. I love you. </p>
