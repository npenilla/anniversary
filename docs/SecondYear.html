		<h1 class=h1> Here we have another great year, and we matured both individually and as a couple. Being in UF for the summer without you sucked, although we did take our first vacation together which I'll never forget. I'll also never forget how much you treated and surprised me with that ultra creative and cute UF Starter Kit, you deserve major props for that one (I still have all of the little cute pictures and signs for each item you made too). This was such a different year too, since we got a lot more freedom since we went to college and got to start doing our own things, and depending on each other more and more.</h1>

		<p class=y2p2> Not to mention we graduated high school together and had our anniverary on the same exact day! If that isn't a sign we're something special I don't know what is. It was an amazing feeling of us conquering such a huge step together and getting to look forward to our next stage in life together at UF. </p>

		<p class=y2p3> Here's are super awesome Finn and Rey costume which we killed (as we always do). You looked gorgeous as always and I was happy to defend the galaxy with you.</p>

		<p class=y2p4> Of course I can't forget how freaking cool it was that you planned and drove us to a cooking class! And we made some healthy spring rolls and learned quite a bit about Vietnamese culture. I love stuff like that.</p>

		<p class=y2p5> That picnic and museum day we had was a lot of fun too, although we had to improvise a little since it started raining so hard! It was still really cool having a little backseat picnic before going shopping at Ikea for college stuff. Not to mention I finally got to take you on a real picnic later which made up for our rained out one. </p>

		<p class=y2p6> Also we have our first year of college football games! We learned the valuable lesson of buying the season passes but it was still really fun seeing our school beat down some other schools (and get beat down every once in a while). It was a fun way to get out and have some fun and really get some UF spirit going, and even though football gets boring it was really nice with you.</p>

		<p class=y2p7> Here we have our first vacation ever, and it was absolutely amazing. Our vacations are always amazing because it's just me and you getting away from it all, having a blast, which we did. From our glorious home at WestGate, to exploring Artegon mall, to Wonderworks, to Disneyquest and some amazing food, to just hanging out at the pool, it was all just great. Someday we're gonna ball out and have the greatest vacation ever had by anyone, and I can't wait for that. Until then, I don't think I'm ever gonna have a bad time with the vacations we have right now. I love you. </p>
